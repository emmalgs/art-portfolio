Emma Gerigscott grew up in Northern Indiana, riding horses through cornfields and raising pet ducks. She received her MFA from the Oregon College of Art and Craft in 2018. Since then she has had several solo shows in Portland, Oregon, and her work as been published in New American Paintings, ArtMaze Magazine, and on the cover of Poetry Northwest. She is the recipient of the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation award (2021) and has received funding from the Regional Arts and Culture Council (Portland, OR).

Gerigscott's art is for the love of animals and yet a sigh of exasperation. In a world of chaos, the artwork she makes is seeking earnestness.

Gerigscott's paintings examine diffidence through narrative. The painted stories are parables in essence, largely informed by soft moments such as the desire to touch feathers or fur––the mystery and infinity that exists in a sticky world––the in/between things that happen around notable experiences. The limbs are a complication of the animal forms; a symbol of both the desire to be loved existing parallel to the intrusion of care.

The materials are the result of the study of craft. The craft of the work is the result of the conversation between the really real (tangible, actual material) and dreaming (envisioning the future of the material, something outside of what currently exists). It is a triangulation of these forms that creates the specificity, playfulness, and narrative of the objects and paintings.
